Negro and minor leagues
Mays's professional baseball career began in 1948 when he played briefly during the summer with the Chattanooga Choo-Choos, a Negro minor league team.[18][19] Later that year, Mays joined the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League, where he was known as "Buck".[20] The Black Barons were managed by Piper Davis, a teammate of Mays's father on the industrial team.[21] When Fairfield Industrial principal E. T. Oliver threatened to suspend Mays for playing professional ball, Davis and Mays's father worked out an agreement. Mays would only play home games for the Black Barons. In return, he could still play high school football.[22] Mays helped Birmingham advance to the 1948 Negro World Series, which they lost 4â€“1 to the Homestead Grays. He hit .262 for the season and stood out because of his excellent fielding and base running.[23]

Several major league teams were interested in signing Mays, but they had to wait until he graduated from high school to offer him a contract. The Boston Braves and the Brooklyn Dodgers both scouted him, but New York Giants scout Eddie Montague signed him to a $4,000 contract.[24] Mays spent the rest of 1950 with the Class B Trenton Giants of the Interstate League, batting .353.[25] Promoted to the Triple-A Minneapolis Millers of the American Association in 1951, he batted .477 in 35 games.[26]
